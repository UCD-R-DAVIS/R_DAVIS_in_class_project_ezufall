#learning dplyr and tidyr: select, filter, and pipes
#only do this once ever:
install.packages("tidyverse")
#We've learned bracket subsetting
#It can be hard to read and prone to error
#dplyr is great for data table manipulation!
#tidyr helps you switch between data formats

#Packages in R are collections of additional functions
#tidyverse is an "umbrella package" that
#includes several packages we'll use this quarter:
#tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2, tibble, etc.

#benefits of tidyverse
#1. Predictable results (base R functionality can vary by data type) 
#2. Good for new learners, because syntax is consistent. 
#3. Avoids hidden arguments and default settings of base R functions

#To load the package type:
library(tidyverse)
#now let's work with a survey dataset
surveys <- read_csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv")


str(surveys)









#select columns
month_day_year <- select(surveys, month, day, year)

#filtering by equals
year_1981 <- filter(surveys, year == 1981)

#filtering by range
filter(surveys, year %in% c(1981:1983))
#5033 results


#review: why should you NEVER do:
filter(surveys, year == c(1981, 1982, 1983))
#1685 results

#This recycles the vector 
#(index-matching, not bucket-matching)
#If you ever really need to do that for some reason,
#comment it ~very~ clearly and explain why you're 
#recycling!

#filtering by multiple conditions
bigfoot_with_weight <- filter(surveys, hindfoot_length > 40 & !is.na(weight))

#multi-step process
small_animals <- filter(surveys, weight < 5)
#this is slightly dangerous because you have to remember 
#to select from small_animals, not surveys in the next step
small_animal_ids <- select(small_animals, record_id, plot_id, species_id)

#same process, using nested functions
small_animal_ids <- select(filter(surveys, weight < 5), record_id, plot_id, species_id)

#same process, using a pipe
#Cmd Shift M
#or |>
#note our select function no longer explicitly calls the tibble
#as its first element
small_animal_ids <- filter(surveys, weight < 5) %>% select(record_id, plot_id, species_id)

#same as
small_animal_ids <- surveys %>% filter(
  weight < 5) %>% 
  select(record_id, 
         plot_id, species_id)

#how to do line breaks with pipes
surveys %>% filter(month==1)

#good:
surveys %>% 
  filter(month==1)

#not good:
surveys 
%>% filter(month==1)
#what happened here?

#line break rules: after open parenthesis, pipe,
#commas, 
#or anything that shows the line is not complete yet




#check out cute_rodent_photos!
#will be updated throughout the quarter
#as a bonus for checking out these videos
#and visiting the code demos on my repository


#one final review of an important concept we learned last week
#applied to the tidyverse

mini <- surveys[190:209,]
table(mini$species_id)
#how many rows have a species ID that's either DM or NL?
nrow(mini)






danger <- mini %>% filter(species_id == c("DM","NL"))

nrow(danger)







#why is nrow(danger) != nrow(mini) if those are the only two species??





tada <- mini[mini$species_id %in% c("DM","NL"),]
nrow(tada)
